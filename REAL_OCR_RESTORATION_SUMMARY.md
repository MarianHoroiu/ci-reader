## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Start/Restart your development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Real OCR:**

   - Go to `/file-upload` page
   - Upload a Romanian ID image (JPG, PNG, or PDF)
   - Click "Upload File"
   - Click "Extract Data"
   - **Expected:** Real OCR processing with progress indicators
   - **Expected:** Real text extraction from your uploaded image

3. **View Results:**
   - Click "View Extracted Data" after processing
   - **Expected:** Actual text from your Romanian ID document
   - **Expected:** Real confidence scores and word-level analysis

## 🔍 What to Look For

**Success Indicators:**

- ✅ No CSP violations in browser console
- ✅ Progress bar shows real OCR stages (initializing → loading → recognizing)
- ✅ Extracted text matches your uploaded document
- ✅ Confidence scores reflect actual OCR quality

**If Issues Occur:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify files are accessible at `http://localhost:3000/workers/tesseract/`
- Look for worker initialization messages

## 🚀 Expected Results

You should now get **real OCR results** from your uploaded Romanian ID documents, including:

- Actual text content from the document
- Real confidence scores
- Proper word/line boundaries
- Romanian character recognition (ă, â, î, ș, ț)

The mock data has been completely removed - you'll only see real OCR results from now on!
