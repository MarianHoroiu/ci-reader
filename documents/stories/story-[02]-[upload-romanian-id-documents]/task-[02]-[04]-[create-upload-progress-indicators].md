Story [03]: Upload Romanian ID Documents

## Task Description

Build comprehensive UI components for upload progress and status indication, providing users with
clear visual feedback during file upload, validation, and compression operations. The system
includes progress bars, status messages, and cancel functionality for optimal user experience.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `components/upload/ProgressBar.tsx` - Animated progress bar component
- Create `components/upload/UploadStatus.tsx` - Upload status display component
- Create `components/upload/StatusMessage.tsx` - Contextual status messages
- Create `components/upload/CancelButton.tsx` - Upload cancellation control
- Create `hooks/useUploadProgress.ts` - React hook for progress tracking
- Create `lib/utils/progress-calculator.ts` - Progress calculation utilities
- Create `styles/components/progress-indicators.module.css` - Progress styling
- Create `__tests__/components/upload/ProgressBar.test.tsx` - Unit tests

### Required Components

- Animated progress bar with percentage display
- Upload status indicators (uploading, validating, compressing, complete, error)
- Contextual status messages for different operation phases
- Cancel upload functionality with proper cleanup
- Multi-file progress tracking and display
- Success and error state indicators
- Estimated time remaining calculation

### Technical Considerations

- Use CSS animations for smooth progress bar transitions
- Implement proper state management for upload phases
- Handle progress tracking for multiple concurrent operations
- Provide accessible progress indicators with ARIA attributes
- Ensure progress calculations are accurate and responsive
- Implement proper cleanup when operations are cancelled
- Consider performance impact of frequent progress updates
- Design responsive indicators for mobile and desktop

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Progress bar component displays accurate upload percentage
- [ ] Status indicators show current operation phase (upload, validate, compress)
- [ ] Contextual messages provide clear information about current operations
- [ ] Cancel functionality properly terminates ongoing operations
- [ ] Multi-file uploads show individual and overall progress
- [ ] Success and error states clearly indicated with appropriate styling
- [ ] Estimated time remaining calculated and displayed accurately
- [ ] Accessible design with proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions enhance user experience
- [ ] Progress updates perform efficiently without UI lag

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for progress calculation and state management
- Visual testing for progress bar animations and transitions
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent uploads
- Cancel functionality testing with proper cleanup verification
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for CSS animations
- Mobile device testing for responsive progress indicators
