## 🔗 Story Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies

- **Story 01**: PWA infrastructure required
- **Story 02**: Offline storage needed for uploaded files

### Downstream Dependencies

- **Story 04**: OCR processing depends on uploaded documents
- **Story 05**: PDF processing requires PDF upload capability

## ⚠️ Story Risks

### High Risk

- **File Format Compatibility**: Various ID document formats and qualities
  - _Mitigation_: Extensive format testing, preprocessing pipeline
- **Mobile Upload Issues**: Camera vs file upload on mobile devices
  - _Mitigation_: Progressive enhancement, mobile-specific testing

### Medium Risk

- **Large File Performance**: Slow processing of high-resolution images
