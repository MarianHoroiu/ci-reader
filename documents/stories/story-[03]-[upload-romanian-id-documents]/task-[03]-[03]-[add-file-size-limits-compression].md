# Task [03]-[03]: Add file size limits and compression

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Upload Romanian ID Documents

## Task Description

Implement file size validation with a maximum limit of 10MB per file and automatic image compression
for oversized files. This system ensures optimal performance while maintaining document quality for
OCR processing, with clear progress indication during compression operations.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `lib/compression/image-compressor.ts` - Core image compression logic
- Create `lib/validation/file-size-validator.ts` - File size validation utilities
- Create `lib/utils/canvas-operations.ts` - Canvas-based image manipulation
- Create `components/upload/CompressionProgress.tsx` - Compression progress indicator
- Create `hooks/useImageCompression.ts` - React hook for compression operations
- Create `lib/constants/compression-settings.ts` - Compression configuration
- Create `lib/utils/quality-optimizer.ts` - Quality optimization algorithms
- Create `__tests__/lib/compression/image-compressor.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Required Components

- File size validation with 10MB maximum limit
- Canvas-based image compression for JPG, PNG, WEBP formats
- Quality optimization to maintain OCR readability
- Progress indicators for compression operations
- Compression settings configuration (quality, dimensions)
- Error handling for compression failures
- Before/after size comparison display

### Technical Considerations

- Use HTML5 Canvas API for client-side image compression
- Implement progressive quality reduction to meet size limits
- Maintain aspect ratio during compression operations
- Preserve image quality sufficient for OCR processing
- Handle different image formats with appropriate compression algorithms
- Implement worker threads for non-blocking compression
- Consider memory usage during compression of large images
- Provide fallback for browsers with limited Canvas support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File size validation enforces 10MB maximum limit per file
- [ ] Image compression automatically triggered for oversized files
- [ ] Compression maintains quality sufficient for OCR processing
- [ ] Progress indicators show compression status and percentage
- [ ] Compression works for JPG, PNG, and WEBP image formats
- [ ] PDF files handled appropriately (validation only, no compression)
- [ ] Before/after file size comparison displayed to users
- [ ] Compression operations complete within 5 seconds for typical files
- [ ] Memory usage optimized to prevent browser crashes
- [ ] Error handling covers compression failures and unsupported scenarios

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for file size validation with various file sizes
- Image compression testing with different formats and qualities
- Performance testing with large images and multiple files
- Quality assessment testing for OCR readability
- Memory usage testing during compression operations
- Error scenario testing (compression failures, unsupported formats)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for Canvas API

## Dependencies

- Task [03]-[02]: File type validation must be implemented first
- Task [03]-[01]: File upload component required for integration

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
