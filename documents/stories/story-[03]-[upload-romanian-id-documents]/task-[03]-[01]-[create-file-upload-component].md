# Task [03]-[01]: Create file upload component with drag-and-drop

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Upload Romanian ID Documents

## Task Description

Build a comprehensive React component that provides both drag-and-drop and click-to-browse
functionality for uploading Romanian ID documents. The component will serve as the primary interface
for users to upload their identity documents in various formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, PDF).

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `components/upload/FileUploadZone.tsx` - Main drag-and-drop upload component
- Create `components/upload/FileDropArea.tsx` - Drag-and-drop area with visual feedback
- Create `components/upload/FileBrowser.tsx` - Click-to-browse file selection component
- Create `components/upload/UploadButton.tsx` - Styled upload trigger button
- Create `lib/utils/file-upload.ts` - File upload utility functions
- Create `hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - React hook for file upload logic
- Create `styles/components/file-upload.module.css` - Component-specific styles
- Create `__tests__/components/upload/FileUploadZone.test.tsx` - Unit tests

### Required Components

- Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback states (idle, drag-over, drop)
- Click-to-browse functionality with hidden file input
- Multiple file selection support
- Visual feedback for drag states (hover, active, invalid)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Integration with Tailwind CSS design system
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Technical Considerations

- Use HTML5 File API for drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement proper event handling for dragenter, dragover, dragleave, drop
- Prevent default browser behavior for drag-and-drop events
- Use React refs for file input element manipulation
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for file events
- Consider touch device compatibility for mobile uploads
- Ensure component works across all supported browsers
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drag-and-drop zone component created with proper visual feedback
- [ ] Click-to-browse functionality implemented with hidden file input
- [ ] Multiple file selection supported through both methods
- [ ] Visual feedback for all drag states (idle, hover, active, invalid)
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop devices
- [ ] Component integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS design system
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all component props and events
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility ensured for all supported browsers
- [ ] Unit tests cover all interaction scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for drag-and-drop event handling using React Testing Library
- File selection testing with mock file objects
- Visual state testing for different drag scenarios
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing for touch interactions
- Integration testing with file validation components

## Dependencies

- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation with Tailwind CSS required
- Task [02]-[01]: IndexedDB wrapper for storing uploaded files

## Estimated Completion Time
