# Task [01]-[06]: Add PWA security headers in next.config.ts

## Parent Story

Story [01]: Install App on Device

## Task Description

Configure security headers for PWA compliance and security, including Content Security Policy,
service worker headers, and other security measures. This ensures the PWA meets security
requirements and passes security audits.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Modify `next.config.ts` - Add comprehensive security headers
- Create `lib/security-headers.ts` - Security header configurations
- Create `middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware for additional security
- Modify `public/sw.js` - Add security considerations to service worker
- Create `app/components/SecurityProvider.tsx` - Security context provider

### Required Components

- Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
- Service Worker security headers
- HTTPS enforcement headers
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers
- Security audit compliance headers

### Technical Considerations

- Configure CSP to allow service worker and PWA functionality
- Set proper headers for service worker scope and caching
- Implement security headers without breaking PWA features
- Consider nonce-based CSP for inline scripts if needed
- Ensure headers work across different deployment environments
- Balance security with PWA functionality requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security headers configured in Next.js config
- [ ] Content Security Policy implemented and working
- [ ] Service worker headers properly set
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement headers configured
- [ ] Security audit passes (Lighthouse security score > 90)
- [ ] PWA functionality not broken by security headers
- [ ] Cross-origin policies properly configured

## Testing Approach

- Run Lighthouse security audit and verify score > 90
- Test PWA functionality with security headers enabled
- Verify service worker works with CSP restrictions
- Test headers in browser developer tools
- Validate security headers using online security scanners
- Test across different browsers for compatibility

## Dependencies

- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation required
- Task [01]-[03]: Service worker implementation needed

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
