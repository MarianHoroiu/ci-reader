# Task [01]-[05]: Configure HTTPS for local development

## Parent Story

Story [01]: Install App on Device

## Task Description

Set up HTTPS for local development to enable PWA features that require secure contexts. This
includes generating SSL certificates, configuring the development server, and ensuring all PWA
functionality works in the development environment.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Modify `next.config.ts` - Add HTTPS configuration for development
- Create `scripts/generate-certs.js` - Script to generate SSL certificates
- Create `certs/` directory - Store development SSL certificates
- Modify `package.json` - Add HTTPS development scripts
- Create `.env.local` - Environment variables for HTTPS
- Update `README.md` - Document HTTPS setup process

### Required Components

- SSL certificate generation (self-signed for development)
- HTTPS development server configuration
- Environment variable management
- Certificate trust setup for browsers
- Development scripts for team setup

### Technical Considerations

- Generate self-signed certificates for localhost
- Configure Next.js to use HTTPS in development
- Handle certificate trust warnings in browsers
- Ensure PWA features work with HTTPS
- Consider mkcert for easier certificate management
- Document setup process for team members

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Local HTTPS development server configured and running
- [ ] SSL certificates properly generated and trusted
- [ ] PWA features work in HTTPS development environment
- [ ] Service worker functions correctly over HTTPS
- [ ] Install prompt appears in development
- [ ] Documentation provided for team setup
- [ ] Development scripts created for easy setup

## Testing Approach

- Verify HTTPS development server starts without errors
- Test PWA features work over HTTPS
- Validate service worker registration over HTTPS
- Test install prompt functionality in development
- Verify certificate trust in different browsers
- Test on different operating systems if possible

## Dependencies

- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation required

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
