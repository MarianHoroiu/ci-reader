# Task [01]-[02]: Configure PWA manifest.json with app metadata

## Parent Story

Story [01]: Install App on Device

## Task Description

Create and configure the web app manifest for PWA installation, including all required metadata,
icons, and display settings. This enables the app to be installable on devices and provides
native-like experience.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest file
- Create `app/layout.tsx` - Add manifest link to HTML head
- Create `public/icons/` directory structure for app icons
- Create `public/icons/icon-192x192.png` - Standard icon size
- Create `public/icons/icon-512x512.png` - Large icon size
- Create `public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS specific icon
- Create `public/favicon.ico` - Browser favicon

### Required Components

- Web App Manifest specification compliance
- App icons in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512)
- Apple touch icon for iOS compatibility
- Proper theme colors and branding
- Display mode configuration for standalone app

### Technical Considerations

- Manifest must meet PWA installability criteria
- Icons should be optimized for different screen densities
- Theme colors should match app branding
- Start URL should be properly configured
- Scope should be set to allow offline functionality
- Display mode should be "standalone" for native-like experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Manifest.json file created with all required fields
- [ ] App icons created in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512)
- [ ] Apple touch icon configured for iOS devices
- [ ] Proper theme colors and background colors set
- [ ] Display mode set to "standalone"
- [ ] Manifest linked in HTML head section
- [ ] Start URL and scope properly configured
- [ ] Manifest validates against PWA requirements

## Testing Approach

- Validate manifest.json using online PWA manifest validators
- Test icon display in browser developer tools
- Verify manifest appears in Application tab of DevTools
- Test install prompt appears when criteria are met
- Validate theme colors are applied correctly

## Dependencies

- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project must be initialized first

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
