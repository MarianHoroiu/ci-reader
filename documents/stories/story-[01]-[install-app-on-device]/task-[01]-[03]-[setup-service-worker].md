# Task [01]-[03]: Set up service worker for offline functionality

## Parent Story

Story [01]: Install App on Device

## Task Description

Implement service worker for caching and offline capabilities, enabling the PWA to work without
internet connection. This includes setting up caching strategies for static assets and implementing
offline fallback pages.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `public/sw.js` - Service worker implementation
- Create `app/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` - SW registration component
- Modify `app/layout.tsx` - Include SW registration
- Create `public/offline.html` - Offline fallback page
- Modify `next.config.ts` - Configure SW settings
- Create `lib/sw-utils.ts` - Service worker utilities

### Required Components

- Service Worker API implementation
- Cache API for storing static assets
- Background sync for offline operations
- Push notification support (future-ready)
- Workbox library for advanced caching strategies

### Technical Considerations

- Service worker must be served from root domain for proper scope
- Implement cache-first strategy for static assets
- Use network-first strategy for dynamic content
- Handle service worker updates and cache invalidation
- Ensure proper error handling for offline scenarios
- Consider cache storage limits and cleanup strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service worker registered and active in browser
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- [ ] Offline fallback pages configured and working
- [ ] Service worker updates properly when code changes
- [ ] Cache invalidation works for new deployments
- [ ] Offline functionality verified in DevTools
- [ ] Service worker scope covers entire application

## Testing Approach

- Test service worker registration in browser DevTools
- Verify caching behavior in Application > Storage tab
- Test offline functionality by disabling network
- Validate cache updates when deploying new versions
- Test service worker lifecycle events
- Verify offline fallback pages display correctly

## Dependencies

- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation required
- Task [01]-[02]: Manifest configuration should be completed

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
