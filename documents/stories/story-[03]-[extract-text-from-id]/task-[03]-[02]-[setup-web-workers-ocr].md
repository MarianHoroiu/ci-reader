# Task [03]-[02]: Set up Web Workers for OCR processing

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Extract Text from ID

## Task Description

Implement Web Workers to prevent UI blocking during OCR processing operations. This task creates a
dedicated worker thread for Tesseract.js operations, ensuring the main UI thread remains responsive
while processing Romanian ID documents.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `public/workers/ocr-worker.js` - Dedicated OCR Web Worker implementation
- Create `lib/workers/ocr-worker-manager.ts` - Web Worker management class
- Create `lib/workers/worker-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for worker communication
- Create `lib/workers/worker-utils.ts` - Utility functions for worker operations
- Create `lib/hooks/useOCRWorker.ts` - React hook for OCR worker integration
- Create `lib/utils/worker-message-handler.ts` - Message handling utilities
- Modify `lib/ocr/ocr-engine.ts` - Integrate with Web Worker system
- Create `lib/workers/worker-error-handler.ts` - Error handling for worker operations

### Required Components

- Web Worker API implementation
- Message passing system between main thread and worker
- Worker lifecycle management (creation, termination, cleanup)
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Progress reporting from worker to main thread
- Worker pool management for multiple concurrent operations
- TypeScript support for worker communication

### Technical Considerations

- Web Worker must be served from public directory for proper loading
- Implement proper message serialization for complex data types
- Handle worker termination and cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Ensure proper error propagation from worker to main thread
- Implement worker timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Consider SharedArrayBuffer for large image data transfer (if supported)
- Handle browser compatibility for Web Worker features
- Implement proper worker state management and recovery

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Web Worker created and properly loaded from public directory
- [ ] Message passing system implemented between main thread and worker
- [ ] OCR operations run in worker without blocking UI
- [ ] Error handling implemented for worker failures and timeouts
- [ ] Worker termination and cleanup functionality working
- [ ] Progress updates sent from worker to main thread
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all worker communication
- [ ] Worker lifecycle management (start, stop, restart) implemented
- [ ] Memory leak prevention through proper worker cleanup
- [ ] Fallback mechanism for browsers without Web Worker support

## Testing Approach

- Unit test Web Worker creation and message passing
- Test OCR processing in worker doesn't block main UI thread
- Verify error handling when worker crashes or times out
- Test worker termination and cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Validate progress reporting from worker to main thread
- Test multiple concurrent OCR operations
- Performance test worker overhead vs main thread processing
- Browser compatibility testing for Web Worker features

## Dependencies

- Task [03]-[01]: Tesseract.js configuration must be completed
- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js 15 project foundation required

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
