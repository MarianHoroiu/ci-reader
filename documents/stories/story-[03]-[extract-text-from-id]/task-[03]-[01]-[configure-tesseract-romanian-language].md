# Task [03]-[01]: Configure Tesseract.js with Romanian language pack

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Extract Text from ID

## Task Description

Set up Tesseract.js OCR engine with Romanian language support to enable accurate text extraction
from Romanian identity documents. This task establishes the foundation for OCR processing with
proper language configuration and character recognition for Romanian-specific characters (ă, â, î,
ș, ț).

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `lib/ocr/tesseract-config.ts` - Tesseract.js configuration and initialization
- Create `lib/ocr/language-packs.ts` - Language pack management utilities
- Create `lib/ocr/ocr-engine.ts` - Main OCR engine wrapper class
- Create `lib/constants/romanian-characters.ts` - Romanian character definitions and validation
- Create `lib/utils/text-processing.ts` - Text processing utilities for Romanian text
- Modify `package.json` - Add Tesseract.js dependencies
- Create `public/tessdata/` directory - Store language pack files
- Create `lib/ocr/ocr-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for OCR operations

### Required Components

- Tesseract.js library (latest stable version)
- Romanian language pack (ron.traineddata)
- OCR worker initialization system
- Language pack download and caching mechanism
- Romanian character validation utilities
- Error handling for OCR initialization failures

### Technical Considerations

- Download Romanian language pack on first use to reduce initial bundle size
- Implement proper error handling for language pack download failures
- Configure Tesseract.js worker options for optimal performance
- Set up proper character whitelist for Romanian ID documents
- Implement fallback to English if Romanian pack fails to load
- Consider memory management for language pack loading
- Ensure compatibility with Next.js 15 and React 19
- Use Web Workers to prevent blocking the main thread during initialization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tesseract.js library successfully integrated into the project
- [ ] Romanian language pack (ron.traineddata) downloaded and configured
- [ ] OCR worker initializes without errors
- [ ] Basic text extraction works with Romanian characters (ă, â, î, ș, ț)
- [ ] Language pack caching implemented to avoid repeated downloads
- [ ] Error handling for language pack download failures
- [ ] OCR engine wrapper class provides clean API for text extraction
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all OCR operations
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for language pack loading
- [ ] Fallback mechanism works if Romanian pack is unavailable

## Testing Approach

- Unit test OCR engine initialization with Romanian language pack
- Test Romanian character recognition with sample text images
- Verify language pack download and caching functionality
- Test error handling when language pack download fails
- Validate memory usage during OCR initialization
- Test fallback to English language pack
- Integration test with actual Romanian ID document samples
- Performance test initialization time and memory consumption

## Dependencies

- Task [02]-[01]: File upload component must be completed for image input
- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js 15 project foundation required

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
