# Task [03]-[03]: Implement image preprocessing pipeline

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Extract Text from ID

## Task Description

Add image enhancement algorithms to improve OCR accuracy by preprocessing Romanian ID document
images before text extraction. This includes contrast adjustment, noise reduction, rotation
correction, and grayscale conversion to optimize images for better Tesseract.js recognition.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `lib/image-processing/preprocessing-pipeline.ts` - Main image preprocessing pipeline
- Create `lib/image-processing/filters/contrast-enhancement.ts` - Contrast and brightness adjustment
- Create `lib/image-processing/filters/noise-reduction.ts` - Noise reduction algorithms
- Create `lib/image-processing/filters/rotation-correction.ts` - Document rotation detection and
  correction
- Create `lib/image-processing/filters/grayscale-conversion.ts` - Optimized grayscale conversion
- Create `lib/image-processing/utils/canvas-utils.ts` - Canvas manipulation utilities
- Create `lib/image-processing/utils/image-analysis.ts` - Image quality analysis tools
- Create `lib/image-processing/types/preprocessing-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- Create `lib/hooks/useImagePreprocessing.ts` - React hook for preprocessing operations

### Required Components

- Canvas API for image manipulation
- Image analysis algorithms for quality assessment
- Contrast and brightness adjustment algorithms
- Gaussian blur and sharpening filters for noise reduction
- Hough transform or similar for rotation detection
- Histogram analysis for optimal grayscale conversion
- Before/after preview functionality
- Processing progress tracking

### Technical Considerations

- Use Canvas API for client-side image processing
- Implement efficient algorithms to minimize processing time
- Preserve image quality while enhancing OCR readability
- Handle various image formats and sizes
- Implement progressive enhancement for different device capabilities
- Consider memory usage for large images
- Provide fallback for browsers with limited Canvas support
- Optimize for Romanian ID document characteristics (fonts, layout)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Image contrast and brightness adjustment implemented and working
- [ ] Noise reduction algorithms reduce image noise without losing text clarity
- [ ] Rotation correction detects and fixes skewed documents (Â±15 degrees)
- [ ] Grayscale conversion optimized for text recognition
- [ ] Processing pipeline handles various image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
- [ ] Before/after preview shows preprocessing effects
- [ ] Processing time remains under 10 seconds for typical ID images
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for mobile devices
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted or invalid images
- [ ] Quality assessment provides feedback on image suitability

## Testing Approach

- Unit test each preprocessing filter individually
- Test preprocessing pipeline with various Romanian ID samples
- Verify rotation correction with skewed document images
- Test noise reduction effectiveness on low-quality scans
- Validate contrast enhancement improves OCR accuracy
- Performance test processing time with different image sizes
- Memory usage testing on mobile devices
- Visual regression testing for preprocessing effects
- Integration test with OCR engine to measure accuracy improvement

## Dependencies

- Task [03]-[01]: Tesseract.js configuration required for testing OCR improvement
- Task [02]-[01]: File upload functionality needed for image input

## Estimated Completion Time

5 hours
