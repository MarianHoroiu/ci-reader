# Task [03]-[04]: Create OCR progress tracking

## Parent Story

Story [03]: Extract Text from ID

## Task Description

Build a comprehensive progress indication system for OCR operations that provides real-time feedback
to users during document processing. This includes progress percentage calculation, processing stage
indicators, and estimated time remaining display to enhance user experience during OCR operations.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `lib/progress/ocr-progress-tracker.ts` - Main progress tracking system
- Create `lib/progress/progress-calculator.ts` - Progress percentage calculation logic
- Create `lib/progress/stage-manager.ts` - Processing stage management
- Create `lib/progress/time-estimator.ts` - Estimated time remaining calculations
- Create `app/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx` - Progress display component
- Create `app/components/ui/StageIndicator.tsx` - Processing stage visualization
- Create `lib/hooks/useOCRProgress.ts` - React hook for progress state management
- Create `lib/types/progress-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for progress tracking
- Modify `lib/workers/ocr-worker-manager.ts` - Integrate progress reporting

### Required Components

- Progress percentage calculation system
- Processing stage enumeration and management
- Time estimation algorithms based on image size and complexity
- Real-time progress updates from Web Worker
- Visual progress indicators (progress bars, spinners, stage indicators)
- Error state handling in progress tracking
- Progress persistence for long-running operations

### Technical Considerations

- Implement accurate progress calculation based on OCR processing stages
- Ensure progress updates don't impact OCR performance
- Handle progress state synchronization between worker and main thread
- Provide meaningful stage descriptions for user understanding
- Implement smooth progress animations without performance impact
- Consider different progress patterns for different image types
- Handle edge cases like very fast or very slow processing
- Ensure progress tracking works across browser tabs/windows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Progress percentage calculation accurately reflects OCR processing state
- [ ] Real-time progress updates sent from Web Worker to UI every 2 seconds
- [ ] Processing stage indicators show current operation (preprocessing, OCR, post-processing)
- [ ] Estimated time remaining calculation based on image complexity and device performance
- [ ] Visual progress indicators display smoothly without performance impact
- [ ] Progress tracking handles errors and provides appropriate feedback
- [ ] Progress state persists during long operations
- [ ] Progress resets properly for new OCR operations
- [ ] Stage descriptions are user-friendly and informative
- [ ] Progress tracking works consistently across different browsers

## Testing Approach

- Unit test progress calculation algorithms with various scenarios
- Test progress updates frequency and accuracy during OCR operations
- Verify stage transitions happen at correct processing points
- Test time estimation accuracy with different image sizes
- Validate progress UI components render correctly
- Test progress tracking with slow and fast OCR operations
- Verify error handling in progress tracking system
- Performance test progress updates don't impact OCR speed
- Cross-browser testing for progress indicator compatibility

## Dependencies

- Task [03]-[02]: Web Worker system must be implemented for progress reporting
- Task [03]-[01]: Tesseract.js configuration needed for OCR operations

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
