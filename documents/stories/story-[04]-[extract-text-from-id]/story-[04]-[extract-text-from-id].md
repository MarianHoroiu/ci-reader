## 🔗 Story Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies

- **Story 03**: Document upload functionality required
- **Story 02**: Offline storage for processing results

### Downstream Dependencies

- **Story 06**: Data correction depends on OCR results
- **Story 10**: Document generation uses extracted data

## ⚠️ Story Risks

### High Risk

- **OCR Accuracy Variability**: Document quality affects extraction accuracy
  - _Mitigation_: Image preprocessing, multiple OCR attempts, manual correction interface
- **Romanian Character Recognition**: Special characters may not be recognized correctly
  - _Mitigation_: Language pack optimization, character validation, post-processing

### Medium Risk

- **Performance on Low-End Devices**: OCR processing is computationally intensive
  - _Mitigation_: Web Workers, progress indicators, processing optimization
- **Memory Usage**: Large images may cause memory issues
  - _Mitigation_: Image compression, memory monitoring, garbage collection

### Low Risk

- **Web Worker Browser Support**: Older browsers may not support Web Workers
  - _Mitigation_: Fallback to main thread processing, feature detection

## 📝 Story Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions

- Users upload reasonably clear, readable documents
- Modern browsers support Web Workers and Canvas API
