## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Connect AI processing pipeline to existing file upload interface. This task seamlessly integrates
the AI-powered Romanian ID extraction functionality with the existing upload UI, ensuring a smooth
user experience while maintaining the established design patterns and user workflows.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Modify `app/file-upload/page.tsx` - Main upload page integration
- Create `app/lib/hooks/useRomanianIDAI.ts` - AI processing integration hook
- Modify `app/components/ui/FileUpload.tsx` - Upload component enhancement
- Create `app/components/ai/AIExtractionResults.tsx` - Results display component
- Modify `app/lib/types/upload-types.ts` - Extended type definitions
- Create `app/components/ai/AIProcessingStatus.tsx` - Processing status component

### Required Components

- Seamless integration with existing upload component
- AI processing trigger after successful upload
- Progress display within existing UI framework
- Results display with extracted field data
- Error handling integrated with existing error system

- Progress display integrated within existing UI framework
- Results display shows extracted field data clearly
- Error handling integrated with existing error system
- Loading states provide appropriate user feedback
- Retry functionality available for failed processing
- UI maintains consistent design patterns and accessibility

## Testing Approach

- Integration testing with existing upload functionality
- User experience testing for AI processing workflow
- Error scenario testing with UI integration
- Accessibility testing for new AI components
- Performance testing for UI responsiveness
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- User acceptance testing for workflow integration

## Dependencies
