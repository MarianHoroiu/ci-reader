# Task 03-06: Integrate AI Processing with Upload Interface

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Seamlessly integrate Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct AI processing capabilities with the existing file upload
interface, creating a unified user experience for Romanian ID extraction. This task connects the AI
processing pipeline with the user interface while maintaining optimal performance and user feedback.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Modify `app/file-upload/page.tsx` - Main upload interface integration
- Create `app/lib/hooks/useQwenAIExtraction.ts` - Qwen2.5-VL processing hook
- Create `app/components/ai/AIExtractionResults.tsx` - Results display component
- Create `app/components/ai/ProcessingStatus.tsx` - Processing status indicator
- Modify `app/components/ui/FileUpload.tsx` - Enhanced upload component
- Create `app/lib/utils/ai-integration-utils.ts` - Integration utility functions

### Required Components

- AI processing trigger integration with file upload
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct processing status display
- Extracted data visualization and editing interface
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Processing cancellation functionality
- Results export and download options
- Performance optimization for UI responsiveness
- Accessibility features for AI processing interface

### Technical Considerations

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct processing time (~8 seconds) UI handling
- State management for AI processing workflow
- Error boundary implementation for AI failures
- Memory management during processing
- Progressive enhancement for AI features
- Mobile responsiveness for AI interface
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Performance optimization for large images

## Acceptance Criteria

- File upload interface triggers Qwen2.5-VL processing seamlessly
- Processing status clearly displayed during AI extraction
- Extracted Romanian ID data presented in user-friendly format
- Error handling provides clear feedback and retry options
- Processing cancellation functionality available to users
- Results can be edited, validated, and exported
- Interface remains responsive during AI processing
- Accessibility standards met for AI processing features

## Testing Approach

- Integration testing between upload and AI processing
- User experience testing for processing workflow
- Error scenario testing (AI failures, network issues)
- Performance testing with various image sizes
- Accessibility testing for AI interface components
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Dependencies

- Task 03-02: AI vision API endpoint must be functional
- Task 03-05: Progress tracking system for status display
- Existing file upload interface from previous stories

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
