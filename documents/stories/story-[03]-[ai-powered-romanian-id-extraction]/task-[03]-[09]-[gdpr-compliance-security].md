# Task 03-09: Implement 100% GDPR Compliance and Security Measures

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Enforce maximum security and EU GDPR compliance with zero external data transmission. This critical
task implements comprehensive privacy protection measures, ensuring complete local processing,
network isolation verification, and full compliance with European data protection regulations.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/security/gdpr-compliance.ts` - GDPR compliance enforcement
- Create `app/lib/security/network-monitor.ts` - Network isolation monitoring
- Create `app/lib/security/data-purger.ts` - Automatic data purging mechanisms
- Create `app/lib/security/crypto-verifier.ts` - Cryptographic proof of local processing
- Create `app/lib/security/audit-logger.ts` - GDPR-compliant audit logging
- Create `app/lib/security/privacy-by-design.ts` - Privacy-by-design architecture
- Create `docs/gdpr-compliance-guide.md` - Legal compliance documentation
- Create `app/lib/security/session-manager.ts` - Session-only data retention

### Required Components

- Network isolation verification during processing
- Cryptographic proof of local-only processing
- GDPR Article 5 (data minimization) implementation
- GDPR Article 25 (privacy by design) architecture
- Security monitoring for external connection attempts
- Automatic data purging mechanisms
- Compliance audit logging and reporting
- Legal documentation for GDPR compliance certification

### Technical Considerations

- Real-time network traffic monitoring and blocking
- Cryptographic hash verification of processing pipeline
- Zero persistent storage of personal data
- Session-based data retention with automatic cleanup
- Air-gapped processing environment enforcement
- Privacy impact assessment implementation
- Data protection officer compliance requirements
- Legal audit trail without PII storage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Network isolation verification prevents external data transmission
- Cryptographic proof of local-only processing implemented
- GDPR Article 5 (data minimization) fully compliant
- GDPR Article 25 (privacy by design) architecture certified
- Security monitoring detects and blocks external connections
- Automatic data purging removes all traces after session
- Compliance audit logging provides complete trail
- Legal documentation supports GDPR compliance certification

## Testing Approach

- Network isolation testing with traffic monitoring
- Cryptographic verification testing
- Data retention and purging validation
- Privacy-by-design architecture verification
- External connection attempt detection testing
- Audit trail completeness verification
- Legal compliance documentation review
- GDPR compliance certification preparation

## Dependencies

- All previous tasks: GDPR compliance must be integrated across entire AI pipeline
- Legal review and approval for compliance documentation
- Security infrastructure for network monitoring

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
