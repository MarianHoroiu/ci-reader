# Task 03-08: Build Fallback and Error Recovery Mechanisms

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Implement robust fallback and error recovery mechanisms for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct processing
failures, ensuring reliable Romanian ID extraction even when AI processing encounters issues. This
task creates multiple recovery strategies and graceful degradation options to maintain system
reliability.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/fallback/qwen-fallback-handler.ts` - Qwen2.5-VL specific fallback logic
- Create `app/lib/error-recovery/ai-error-handler.ts` - AI processing error management
- Create `app/lib/fallback/retry-strategies.ts` - Intelligent retry mechanisms
- Create `app/lib/fallback/degraded-processing.ts` - Graceful degradation options
- Create `app/components/error/ErrorRecovery.tsx` - Error recovery UI component
- Create `app/lib/monitoring/error-tracking.ts` - Error monitoring and logging

### Required Components

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct connection failure handling
- Model unavailability detection and recovery
- Processing timeout management and retry logic
- Image quality-based fallback strategies
- Manual extraction interface as ultimate fallback
- Error classification and appropriate response selection
- User notification system for recovery attempts
- Performance monitoring for fallback effectiveness

### Technical Considerations

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct specific error patterns and responses
- Ollama service availability monitoring
- Network connectivity issues and offline handling
- Memory constraints and resource management
- Processing timeout thresholds (~8 seconds for Qwen2.5-VL)
- Retry backoff strategies to prevent system overload
- Error logging and monitoring for system improvement
- User experience during error recovery processes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Qwen2.5-VL connection failures handled gracefully
- Model unavailability detected and recovery attempted
- Processing timeouts trigger appropriate retry mechanisms
- Image quality issues prompt preprocessing adjustments
- Manual extraction interface available as final fallback
- Error classification system routes to appropriate recovery
- User notifications provide clear status during recovery
- Performance monitoring tracks fallback effectiveness

## Testing Approach

- Qwen2.5-VL connection failure simulation and recovery testing
- Model unavailability scenario testing
- Processing timeout testing with various image complexities
- Network connectivity interruption testing
- Resource constraint testing (low memory, high CPU)
- User experience testing during error scenarios
- Recovery mechanism effectiveness validation

## Dependencies

- Task 03-02: AI vision API endpoint for error integration
- Task 03-01: Ollama and Qwen2.5-VL setup for failure simulation
- Error monitoring infrastructure

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
