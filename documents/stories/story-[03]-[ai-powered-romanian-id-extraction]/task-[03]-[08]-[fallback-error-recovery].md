# Task 03-08: Add Fallback and Error Recovery Mechanisms

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Implement robust error handling and fallback strategies. This task creates comprehensive error
recovery mechanisms that ensure the application remains functional even when AI processing fails,
providing users with alternative workflows and clear recovery options.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/ai/error-handler.ts` - Centralized AI error handling
- Create `app/lib/ai/fallback-strategies.ts` - Fallback mechanism implementations
- Create `app/lib/ai/retry-manager.ts` - Intelligent retry logic
- Create `app/components/ui/ErrorRecovery.tsx` - Error recovery UI component
- Create `app/lib/utils/error-logger.ts` - Error logging and reporting
- Create `app/lib/ai/health-monitor.ts` - AI system health monitoring
- Modify `app/lib/hooks/useRomanianIDAI.ts` - Error handling integration

### Required Components

- Graceful handling of AI model failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Fallback to manual data entry when AI fails
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Health monitoring for AI system components
- Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

### Technical Considerations

- Error classification (transient vs. permanent failures)
- Exponential backoff for retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker implementation for system protection
- Error boundary integration for React components
- Offline capability when AI services are unavailable
- Performance impact of error handling overhead
- User experience during error scenarios
- Error telemetry and monitoring integration

## Acceptance Criteria

- Graceful handling of AI model failures implemented
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors functional
- Fallback to manual data entry available when AI fails
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting operational
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options provided
- Health monitoring for AI system components working
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents system overload
- Error recovery UI guides users through alternative workflows

## Testing Approach

- Error scenario simulation and handling validation
- Retry mechanism testing with various failure types
- Fallback workflow testing and user experience validation
- Error logging accuracy and completeness verification
- Health monitoring system testing
- Circuit breaker functionality testing
- Performance impact assessment of error handling
- User acceptance testing for error recovery workflows

## Dependencies

- All previous tasks: Comprehensive error handling requires integration with all AI components
- Logging infrastructure for error reporting
- Manual data entry fallback interface

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
