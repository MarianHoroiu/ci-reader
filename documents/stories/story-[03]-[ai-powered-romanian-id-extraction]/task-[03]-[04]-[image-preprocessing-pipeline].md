# Task 03-04: Build Image Preprocessing Pipeline for AI Input

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Create image optimization pipeline for better AI processing results. This task implements a
comprehensive image preprocessing system that enhances image quality, corrects orientation, and
optimizes format for the LLaMA 3.2 Vision model to achieve maximum accuracy in Romanian ID field
extraction.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/image-processing/preprocessing-pipeline.ts` - Main preprocessing pipeline
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/image-enhancer.ts` - Image quality enhancement utilities
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/format-converter.ts` - Image format conversion logic
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/orientation-corrector.ts` - Automatic orientation detection and
  correction
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/noise-reducer.ts` - Noise reduction and cleanup algorithms
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/contrast-optimizer.ts` - Contrast and brightness optimization
- Create `app/lib/utils/base64-encoder.ts` - Base64 encoding for AI model input

### Required Components
