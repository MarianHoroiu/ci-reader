# Task 03-04: Build Image Preprocessing Pipeline for AI Input

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Implement an optimized image preprocessing pipeline specifically designed for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
model input, ensuring optimal image quality while maintaining processing speed and GDPR compliance
through local-only processing. This task focuses on preparing images for maximum AI extraction
accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/image-processing/qwen-preprocessor.ts` - Qwen2.5-VL optimized preprocessing
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/image-optimizer.ts` - Image quality enhancement
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/format-converter.ts` - Image format standardization
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/rotation-detector.ts` - Automatic rotation correction
- Create `app/lib/image-processing/quality-analyzer.ts` - Image quality assessment
- Create `app/lib/utils/image-validation.ts` - Image validation utilities

### Required Components

- Image format detection and conversion (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
- Automatic rotation correction for Romanian ID orientation
- Image quality enhancement (contrast, sharpness, noise reduction)
- Size optimization for Qwen2.5-VL input requirements
- Quality assessment and validation
- Memory-efficient processing pipeline
- Error handling for corrupted images
- Performance optimization for <2 second preprocessing

### Technical Considerations

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct optimal input specifications
- Image resolution optimization (balance quality vs processing speed)
- Memory usage during preprocessing (efficient algorithms)
- Romanian ID card layout and orientation detection
- Color space optimization for document processing
- Compression settings for AI model input
- Browser compatibility for client-side processing
- Security considerations for image handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- Image preprocessing pipeline optimized for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
- Automatic rotation correction for Romanian ID cards
- Image quality enhancement without over-processing
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
- Processing time under 2 seconds for typical images
- Memory usage optimization for large images
- Quality validation and error handling
- GDPR compliance with local-only processing

## Testing Approach

- Image quality improvement validation
- Processing time benchmarking with various image sizes
- Memory usage testing during preprocessing
- Rotation correction accuracy testing
- Format conversion reliability testing
- Edge case testing (corrupted, extremely large images)
- Performance testing on different hardware configurations

## Dependencies

- Task 03-03: Romanian ID extraction prompts for optimization guidance
- Image processing libraries (Canvas API, Sharp, or similar)
- Browser APIs for client-side processing

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
