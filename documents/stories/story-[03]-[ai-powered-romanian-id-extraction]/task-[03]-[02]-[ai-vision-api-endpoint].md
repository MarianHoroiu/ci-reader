# Task 03-02: Create AI Vision Processing API Endpoint

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Build Next.js API route for handling image processing with LLaMA 3.2 Vision. This endpoint will
serve as the main interface between the frontend application and the local Ollama server, handling
image uploads, processing requests, and returning structured data extracted from Romanian ID
documents.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/api/ai-vision-ocr/route.ts` - Main API endpoint for AI vision processing
- Create `app/lib/ai/vision-processor.ts` - Core vision processing logic
- Create `app/lib/ai/ollama-integration.ts` - Ollama API integration utilities
- Create `app/lib/types/ai-vision-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for AI processing
- Create `app/lib/utils/image-validation.ts` - Image format and size validation
- Create `app/lib/utils/response-formatter.ts` - Structured response formatting

### Required Components

- Next.js API route handler with POST method support
- Image upload validation and processing
- Ollama chat API integration for vision model
- Error handling for API failures and timeouts
- Request/response logging for debugging
- Rate limiting for API protection
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

### Technical Considerations

- Maximum image size limits (10MB recommended)
- Supported image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
- Base64 encoding for Ollama vision model input
- Timeout handling for long-running AI inference
- Memory management for large image processing
- Concurrent request handling and queuing
- Error response standardization
- Security headers and input sanitization

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/api/ai-vision-ocr` endpoint created and functional
- Image upload and validation handling implemented
- Integration with Ollama chat API for vision processing
- Structured response format for extracted data
- Error handling for API failures and model unavailability
- Request timeout protection (30 seconds maximum)
- Input validation for image format and size
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for API endpoint functionality
- Integration tests with Ollama server
- Image upload validation testing
- Error scenario testing (invalid images, model failures)
- Performance testing with various image sizes
- Concurrent request handling validation
- API response format verification

## Dependencies

- Task 03-01: Ollama server and LLaMA 3.2 Vision model must be operational
- Story 02: File upload infrastructure for image handling

## Estimated Completion Time

5 hours
