# Task 03-01: Set Up Ollama Server and Qwen2.5-VL Model

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Install and configure Ollama with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model for local AI processing. This task
establishes the foundation for AI-powered document processing by setting up the local inference
server and downloading the required vision model. The setup ensures complete privacy compliance by
keeping all AI processing local to the user's machine.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `scripts/setup-ollama.sh` - Automated Ollama installation script
- Create `scripts/install-qwen-vision.sh` - Qwen2.5-VL model download script
- Create `docs/ollama-setup-guide.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation
- Create `app/lib/ai/ollama-client.ts` - Ollama API client wrapper
- Create `app/lib/ai/model-health-check.ts` - Model availability verification
- Modify `package.json` - Add Ollama-related scripts and dependencies

### Required Components

- Ollama server installation (latest version)
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model (optimized quantization)
- Health check endpoint for model availability
- Error handling for installation failures
- System requirements validation
- Documentation for team onboarding

### Technical Considerations

- Minimum 6GB RAM requirement for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
- Disk space requirement: ~12GB for model storage
- Network bandwidth for initial model download (~8GB)
- Platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- GPU acceleration support (optional but recommended)
- Model quantization options for different hardware configurations
- Ollama API endpoint configuration (localhost:11434)
- Security considerations for local AI server

## Acceptance Criteria

- Ollama installed and running on localhost:11434
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model downloaded and available
- Model health check endpoint functional
- Documentation for team setup and troubleshooting
- Automated setup scripts for different platforms
- System requirements validation before installation
- Error handling for insufficient resources
- Model loading verification and performance testing

## Testing Approach

- Verify Ollama installation on different operating systems
- Test model download and initialization process
- Validate health check endpoint responses
- Performance testing with sample images
- Resource usage monitoring during model loading
- Error scenario testing (insufficient RAM, disk space)
- Documentation accuracy verification

## Dependencies

- Story 01: PWA infrastructure must be established
- Story 02: File upload functionality for testing integration

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
