# Task 03-05: Create AI Processing Progress Tracking

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Implement real-time progress tracking for AI processing stages. This task creates a comprehensive
progress monitoring system that provides users with real-time feedback during the AI processing
workflow, including stage descriptions, progress indicators, and error state management.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/hooks/useAIProcessingProgress.ts` - React hook for progress tracking
- Create `app/lib/ai/progress-tracker.ts` - Core progress tracking logic
- Create `app/components/ui/AIProcessingProgress.tsx` - Progress display component
- Create `app/lib/types/progress-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for progress states
- Create `app/lib/utils/progress-calculator.ts` - Progress calculation utilities
- Create `app/lib/websocket/progress-websocket.ts` - WebSocket implementation for real-time updates

### Required Components

- Progress indicators for processing stages (upload, preprocessing, AI inference, validation)
- WebSocket or polling mechanism for real-time updates
- Processing stage descriptions for user feedback
- Timeout handling and cancellation support
- Error state management and recovery options
- Progress percentage calculation
- Estimated time remaining calculation

### Technical Considerations

- Real-time communication between frontend and backend
- WebSocket connection management and fallback to polling
- Progress state persistence during page refresh
- Cancellation token implementation for long-running operations
- Error boundary integration for progress component
- Accessibility considerations for progress indicators
- Mobile-responsive progress display
- Performance optimization for frequent updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- Progress indicators for all processing stages implemented
- WebSocket or polling for real-time updates functional
- Processing stage descriptions provide clear user feedback
- Timeout handling and cancellation support operational
- Error state management and recovery mechanisms working
- Progress percentage accurately reflects processing status
- Estimated time remaining calculation implemented
- Cancellation functionality allows users to abort processing

## Testing Approach

- Progress tracking accuracy testing across all stages
- Real-time update functionality validation
- WebSocket connection stability testing
- Cancellation mechanism testing
- Error state handling verification
- Performance testing with concurrent progress tracking
- Accessibility testing for progress indicators
- Mobile responsiveness validation

## Dependencies

- Task 03-02: AI vision processing API endpoint for progress integration
- Task 03-04: Image preprocessing pipeline for stage tracking
- WebSocket infrastructure or polling mechanism

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
