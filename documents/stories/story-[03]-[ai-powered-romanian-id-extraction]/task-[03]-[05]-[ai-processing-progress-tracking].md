# Task 03-05: Implement AI Processing Progress Tracking

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Create a comprehensive progress tracking system for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct processing operations,
providing real-time feedback to users during the AI extraction process. This task ensures users have
clear visibility into processing status and estimated completion times for optimal user experience.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/progress/qwen-progress-tracker.ts` - Qwen2.5-VL specific progress tracking
- Create `app/lib/progress/processing-stages.ts` - Processing stage definitions
- Create `app/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx` - Progress visualization component
- Create `app/lib/hooks/useProcessingProgress.ts` - Progress tracking React hook
- Create `app/lib/utils/time-estimator.ts` - Processing time estimation utilities
- Create `app/lib/types/progress-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for progress tracking

### Required Components

- Real-time progress updates during Qwen2.5-VL processing
- Processing stage indicators (image upload, preprocessing, AI analysis, data extraction)
- Time estimation based on image size and complexity
- Error state handling and user feedback
- Progress persistence across page refreshes
- Cancellation support for long-running operations
- Performance metrics collection
- User-friendly progress visualization

### Technical Considerations

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct processing time characteristics (~8 seconds)
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Progress state management and persistence
- Memory usage during progress tracking
- Browser compatibility for real-time features
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance impact of progress tracking
- User experience optimization for perceived performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- Real-time progress tracking for Qwen2.5-VL processing operations
- Clear stage indicators for each processing step
- Accurate time estimation based on image characteristics
- Error state handling with user-friendly messages
- Progress persistence across browser sessions
- Cancellation functionality for ongoing operations
- Performance metrics collection for optimization
- Responsive progress visualization across devices

## Testing Approach

- Progress accuracy testing with various image types
- Time estimation validation against actual processing times
- Error scenario testing (network failures, model unavailability)
- Performance testing for progress tracking overhead
- User experience testing for progress visualization
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Dependencies

- Task 03-02: AI vision API endpoint for progress integration
- Task 03-04: Image preprocessing pipeline for stage tracking
- Real-time communication infrastructure (WebSocket/SSE)

## Estimated Completion Time

3 hours
