# Task 03-07: Implement Data Validation and Confidence Scoring

## Parent Story

Story 03: AI-Powered Romanian ID Extraction

## Task Description

Develop comprehensive data validation and confidence scoring system for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
extracted Romanian ID data, ensuring accuracy and reliability of AI-generated results. This task
implements validation rules specific to Romanian ID formats and provides confidence metrics for each
extracted field.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `app/lib/validation/romanian-id-validator.ts` - Romanian ID field validation
- Create `app/lib/ai/qwen-confidence-scorer.ts` - Qwen2.5-VL confidence analysis
- Create `app/lib/validation/field-validators.ts` - Individual field validation logic
- Create `app/lib/utils/confidence-calculator.ts` - Confidence score computation
- Create `app/components/validation/ValidationResults.tsx` - Validation display component
- Create `app/lib/types/validation-types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for validation

### Required Components

- Romanian CNP (Cod Numeric Personal) validation
- Date format validation (birth date, issue date, expiry date)
- Name validation with Romanian character support
- Address validation for Romanian administrative divisions
- Document series and number format validation
- Confidence scoring for each extracted field
- Overall extraction confidence assessment
- Validation error reporting and suggestions

### Technical Considerations

- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct output confidence analysis
- Romanian ID format specifications and rules
- CNP algorithm validation (checksum calculation)
- Romanian administrative division validation
- Date format consistency checking
- Name format validation with diacritics
- Confidence threshold configuration
- Performance optimization for validation algorithms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Romanian CNP validation with checksum verification
- Date format validation for all date fields
- Name validation supporting Romanian characters (ă, â, î, ș, ț)
- Address validation against Romanian administrative divisions
- Document format validation for series and numbers
- Confidence scoring implemented for each field
- Overall extraction confidence calculated
- Validation results clearly displayed to users

## Testing Approach

- CNP validation testing with valid and invalid codes
- Date format validation with various input formats
- Name validation with Romanian character combinations
- Address validation against known Romanian locations
- Confidence scoring accuracy validation
- Edge case testing for malformed data
- Performance testing for validation algorithms

## Dependencies

- Task 03-03: Romanian ID extraction prompts for field definitions
- Task 03-06: UI integration for validation display
- Romanian ID format specifications and validation rules

## Estimated Completion Time

4 hours
