## 🔗 Story Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies

- **Story 01**: PWA infrastructure must be established first

### Downstream Dependencies

- **All Epic 2-5 stories**: Depend on offline data storage and management
- **Story 2.1**: Document upload requires offline storage
- **Story 3.1**: Template management requires offline storage

## ⚠️ Story Risks

### High Risk

- **IndexedDB Browser Support**: Older browsers may have limited support
  - _Mitigation_: Progressive enhancement, fallback to localStorage
- **Data Corruption**: Risk of data loss during offline operations
  - _Mitigation_: Data validation, backup strategies, error recovery

### Medium Risk

- **Storage Limitations**: Browser storage quotas may limit functionality
  - _Mitigation_: Storage monitoring, data cleanup, user notifications
- **Performance Degradation**: Large datasets may slow down operations
  - _Mitigation_: Data pagination, lazy loading, performance monitoring

### Low Risk

- **Network Detection Accuracy**: False positives/negatives in connectivity detection
  - _Mitigation_: Multiple detection methods, user override options

## 📝 Story Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions

- Users' browsers support IndexedDB and modern storage APIs
- Users have sufficient local storage space (minimum 1GB)
- Network connectivity is intermittent or unreliable
- Users understand offline vs online functionality

### Business Assumptions

- Offline functionality is critical for user adoption
- Data privacy is more important than cloud synchronization
- Users prefer local data control over convenience features
- Offline capability provides competitive advantage

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- IndexedDB wrapper functionality
- Network status detection accuracy
- Data persistence across sessions
- Offline-first data operations

### Integration Tests
