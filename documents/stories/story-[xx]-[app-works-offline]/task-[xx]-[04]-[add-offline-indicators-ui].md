# Task [02]-[04]: Add offline indicators in UI

## Parent Story

Story [02]: App Works Offline

## Task Description

Create comprehensive UI components and indicators to show offline status and available capabilities
to users. These components will provide clear visual feedback about the app's current state and help
users understand what functionality is available offline.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `components/ui/NetworkStatusIndicator.tsx` - Main network status indicator component
- Create `components/ui/OfflineBanner.tsx` - Offline mode banner component
- Create `components/ui/ConnectionQualityIndicator.tsx` - Connection quality display
- Create `components/ui/OfflineCapabilities.tsx` - Available offline features display
- Create `components/layout/StatusBar.tsx` - Global status bar component
- Modify `app/layout.tsx` - Integrate status indicators into main layout
- Create `styles/components/network-status.module.css` - Component-specific styles
- Create `__tests__/components/ui/NetworkStatusIndicator.test.tsx` - Unit tests

### Required Components

- Network status indicator with visual states (online, offline, poor connection)
- Offline banner with contextual messaging
- Connection quality indicator with speed/latency metrics
- Offline capabilities display showing available features
- Toast notifications for status changes
- Consistent design system integration

### Technical Considerations

- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with app theme
- Implement accessible design with proper ARIA labels and roles
- Create responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Use semantic colors (green for online, red for offline, yellow for poor connection)
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for status changes
- Consider user preferences for notification frequency
- Ensure indicators don't interfere with main app functionality
- Implement proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Offline status indicator component displays current network state
- [ ] Contextual offline messaging explains available functionality
- [ ] Clear indication of available features when offline
- [ ] Consistent design integration with app theme and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Accessible design with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop devices
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations for status changes
- [ ] Toast notifications inform users of connectivity changes
- [ ] Connection quality metrics displayed when available
- [ ] Status indicators positioned non-intrusively in the UI

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for all UI components using React Testing Library
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Visual regression testing for different network states
- Responsive design testing across device sizes
- User experience testing with real network state changes
- Integration testing with network detection system

## Dependencies

- Task [02]-[03]: Network status detection must be implemented first
- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation with Tailwind CSS required

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
