# Task [02]-[03]: Create network status detection

## Parent Story

Story [02]: App Works Offline

## Task Description

Implement comprehensive network connectivity monitoring and status detection that works reliably
across all supported browsers. This system will provide real-time connectivity information and
enable the app to respond appropriately to network state changes.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `lib/network/network-detector.ts` - Core network status detection logic
- Create `lib/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` - React hook for network status
- Create `lib/utils/connection-quality.ts` - Connection quality assessment utilities
- Create `contexts/NetworkContext.tsx` - React context for network state
- Create `lib/network/network-events.ts` - Network event handling utilities
- Create `__tests__/lib/network/network-detector.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Required Components

- Network status detection using multiple browser APIs
- Real-time connectivity monitoring with event listeners
- Connection quality assessment (speed, latency)
- Cross-browser compatibility layer
- React hooks and context for component integration
- Network state change event handling

### Technical Considerations

- Use Navigator.onLine API as primary detection method
- Implement Network Information API for enhanced connectivity details
- Add ping-based connectivity verification for accuracy
- Handle browser-specific quirks and limitations
- Implement debouncing for rapid connection state changes
- Consider false positive/negative scenarios
- Provide fallback detection methods for older browsers
- Implement connection quality metrics (effective connection type)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Network status detection works across all supported browsers
- [ ] Real-time connectivity monitoring with immediate state updates
- [ ] Status change event handling with proper debouncing
- [ ] Connection quality assessment provides meaningful metrics
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility ensured with fallback methods
- [ ] React hook provides easy component integration
- [ ] Network context enables global state management
- [ ] False positive/negative scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance impact minimal (< 1% CPU usage)
- [ ] Unit tests cover all detection scenarios and edge cases

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for network detection logic across browser APIs
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Network simulation testing (offline, slow, fast connections)
- Event handling testing with rapid state changes
- Performance testing for continuous monitoring
- Edge case testing (airplane mode, VPN, proxy scenarios)

## Dependencies

- Task [02]-[01]: IndexedDB wrapper for storing network state
- Task [01]-[01]: Next.js project foundation required

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
