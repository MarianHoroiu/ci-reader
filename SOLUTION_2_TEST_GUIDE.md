# Solution 2: Server-Side OCR Test Guide

## Overview

Solution 2 moves OCR processing from client-side Web Workers to server-side API routes, avoiding all
the CSP and worker path issues that were causing problems.

## What Changed

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

- ‚úÖ Fixed `serverExternalPackages: ['tesseract.js']` (moved out of experimental)
- ‚úÖ Added `outputFileTracingIncludes` for WASM files
- ‚úÖ Removed deprecated experimental configuration

### 2. New Server-Side API (`app/api/ocr/route.ts`)

- ‚úÖ POST endpoint that processes images server-side
- ‚úÖ Uses Tesseract.js with Node.js worker paths
- ‚úÖ Returns structured OCR results
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and logging

### 3. New Client Hook (`app/lib/hooks/useServerOCR.ts`)

- ‚úÖ `useServerOCR()` - Generic server OCR hook
- ‚úÖ `useRomanianIDServerOCR()` - Romanian ID specific hook
- ‚úÖ Simulated progress updates (since server doesn't provide real-time progress)
- ‚úÖ Romanian ID text parsing

### 4. Updated File Upload Page (`app/file-upload/page.tsx`)

- ‚úÖ Switched from `useRomanianIDOCR` to `useRomanianIDServerOCR`
- ‚úÖ File to data URL conversion for server processing
- ‚úÖ useEffect hooks for state management

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**

- ‚úÖ No configuration warnings about experimental features
- ‚úÖ Server starts on https://localhost:3001
- ‚úÖ No CSP violations in console

### Step 2: Navigate to File Upload

```
https://localhost:3001/file-upload
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Page loads without errors
- ‚úÖ File upload component is visible
- ‚úÖ No worker-related errors in console

### Step 3: Upload Romanian ID Image

1. Click the upload area or drag & drop a Romanian ID image
2. Select a `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` file
3. Click "Start Upload"

**Expected Behavior:**

- ‚úÖ File uploads successfully
- ‚úÖ "Extract Data" button appears
- ‚úÖ No upload errors

### Step 4: Extract OCR Data

1. Click "Extract Data" button
2. Watch the progress indicators

**Expected Behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows: "Initializing OCR engine..." (10%)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows: "Loading language data..." (30%)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows: "Recognizing text..." (60%)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows: "Processing results..." (90%)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar shows: "OCR completed successfully!" (100%)
- ‚úÖ Extracted text appears in results section

### Step 5: Verify Server Processing

Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running:

**Expected Server Logs:**

```
OCR Progress: initializing - 0.0%
OCR Progress: loading - 10.0%
OCR Progress: recognizing - 50.0%
OCR Progress: recognizing - 100.0%
```

### Step 6: Check Network Tab

Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:

**Expected Requests:**

- ‚úÖ POST `/api/ocr` request
- ‚úÖ Request payload contains `imageData` and `language: "ron"`
- ‚úÖ Response contains `success: true` and OCR result
- ‚úÖ No failed requests to worker files

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'tesseract.js'"

**Solution:**

```bash
npm install tesseract.js
```

### Issue: API route returns 500 error

**Check:**

1. Server logs for detailed error messages
2. Tesseract.js installation: `npm list tesseract.js`
3. Image data format (should be data URL)

### Issue: No progress updates

**Expected:** Progress is simulated on client-side since server processing doesn't provide real-time
updates

### Issue: Romanian text not recognized

**Check:**

1. Image quality and resolution
2. Text orientation and clarity
3. Language setting (should be 'ron' for Romanian)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No CSP violations in browser console
- [ ] No worker-related errors
- [ ] File upload works correctly
- [ ] "Extract Data" button appears after upload
- [ ] Progress indicators show during processing
- [ ] OCR results appear with extracted text
- [ ] Server logs show OCR progress
- [ ] Network requests to `/api/ocr` succeed
- [ ] Romanian text is properly recognized

## Performance Notes

### Advantages of Solution 2:

- ‚úÖ No client-side worker issues
- ‚úÖ No CSP violations
- ‚úÖ Server has more resources for processing
- ‚úÖ Consistent environment (no browser differences)

### Considerations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server processing takes longer than client-side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No real-time progress (simulated on client)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires server resources for each OCR request
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image data sent over network (larger payload)

## Success Criteria

Solution 2 is working correctly if:

1. **No Console Errors**: Browser console is clean of worker/CSP errors
2. **Successful OCR Processing**: Text is extracted from Romanian ID images
3. **Proper Progress Feedback**: User sees progress indicators during processing
4. **Server Logs**: Terminal shows OCR processing progress
5. **Network Success**: API requests to `/api/ocr` return successful responses

## Next Steps

If Solution 2 works correctly:

- ‚úÖ Keep this implementation for production
- ‚úÖ Consider adding caching for repeated OCR requests
- ‚úÖ Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- ‚úÖ Optimize image preprocessing on server

If Solution 2 has issues:

- üîÑ Try Solution 3 (Dynamic Blob Workers)
- üîÑ Check server environment and dependencies
- üîÑ Verify Tesseract.js installation and configuration
