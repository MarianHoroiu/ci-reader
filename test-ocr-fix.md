# OCR Fix Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CSP Violations

- **Problem**: WASM data URLs were blocked by Content Security Policy
- **Solution**: Updated `lib/security-headers.ts` to allow `data:` and `blob:` URLs for WASM loading
- **Changes**:
  - Added `data:` to `connect-src` directive
  - Added `blob:` to `connect-src` directive
  - Added `data:` to `worker-src` directive

### 2. Tesseract Parameter Errors

- **Problem**: `tessedit_ocr_engine_mode` can only be set during initialization
- **Solution**: Updated worker configuration to include OEM in initial config
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `public/workers/ocr-worker.js` to include OEM in `tesseractConfig`
  - Removed OEM from runtime parameter setting

### 3. Unknown Worker Messages

- **Problem**: Worker manager receiving messages from unregistered workers
- **Solution**: Enhanced worker ID management and message handling
- **Status**: Partially addressed through configuration improvements

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console**

   - Navigate to `https://localhost:3000/file-upload`
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check Console for errors

3. **Test OCR Functionality**
   - Upload a Romanian ID image
   - Click "Extract Data" button
   - Monitor console for:
     - ✅ No CSP violations
     - ✅ No "tessedit_ocr_engine_mode" errors
     - ✅ Successful worker initialization
     - ✅ OCR processing completion

## Expected Results

### Before Fix

```
❌ CSP Violation: Refused to connect to 'data:application/octet-stream...'
❌ Worker Error: tessedit_ocr_engine_mode can only be set during initialization
❌ Unknown worker messages
❌ Worker initialization failed
```

### After Fix

```
✅ Service Worker: Activated securely
✅ Worker initialized successfully
✅ OCR processing started
✅ Text extraction completed
```

## Monitoring Points

1. **Network Tab**: Check that WASM files load without CSP blocks
2. **Console**: No CSP violation errors
3. **Application Tab**: Service Worker status should be active
4. **OCR Results**: Should extract actual text from Romanian ID

## Fallback Options

If issues persist, consider:

1. **Option A**: Use local WASM files instead of data URLs
2. **Option B**: Implement alternative OCR library (tesseract-wasm)
3. **Option C**: Server-side OCR processing

## Configuration Files Modified

- `lib/security-headers.ts` - Enhanced CSP configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Added worker file headers
- `public/workers/ocr-worker-simple.js` - Simplified worker implementation
- `app/lib/workers/ocr-worker-manager.ts` - Updated to use simplified worker
- `app/lib/ocr/tesseract-config.ts` - Tesseract configuration

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CSP Configuration

- Added `script-src-elem` directive for worker scripts
- Added `data:` and `blob:` URLs to `connect-src` and `worker-src`
- Allows local WASM loading without CDN dependencies

### 2. Simplified Worker Implementation

- Created `ocr-worker-simple.js` based on Tesseract.js documentation
- Uses correct `createWorker(language, 1, options)` API
- Eliminates complex configuration that caused CSP violations
- Proper error handling and progress reporting

### 3. Next.js Configuration

- Added specific headers for `/workers/:path*` routes
- Ensures proper MIME types for JavaScript files
- Optimized caching for worker assets

### 4. Worker Manager Updates

- Updated to use simplified worker
- Improved worker ID management
- Better error handling and communication
